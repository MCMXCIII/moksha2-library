## Download your textbook for only a dollar 

I am starting a project  to help all of those who can;t afford books and give them a way to get what they need at a fair price. Fair for 1 U.S. Dollar
pay in cryptocurrency to the address below and include an ISBN number it just that simple.

## What is this?

#### Q: What is this?

Hello I am a guy who is fed up with the educational system in my country and looking for ways to help students. I was once(and still am a poor scollege student) getting worked by the system. I just want to ease the financial burden a bit by helping those with books or any other type of reading material that maybe required for a class or course/program. 


I want to give people a chance to do great things and help them by giving a fair price for books. I have written an entire post about who the publication system atifles innovtion and impedes scientific progress. I will link below. 

## Books 

#### Q: How can I get a book?

The easiest way is to join the chat talk for a little bit and ask for a book and if I have a copy I will upload it and give you a link to download it.

#### Q: What's this all cost?

I am asking 1 U.S. Dollar per download Ideally I may even give it out for free and in exchange ask for a little computer power by participating in a monero based web miner for a few hashes in exchange for a download link. I want to keep prices as low as possble and stil provide qaulity to those you need or ask for it.

#### Q: Why Charge at all?

I charge because I am struggling like you all too and I would build this out of the kindness of my heart but not everyone is as kind as I am and wont let me host for free.


#### Q: I can't pay is there anything else I can do?

I am asking you would mine a few hashes of cryptocurrencies in exchange for my service. I do not want ads on my site and in order to do that I have to be able to pay server costseven with a few hashes here and there I should be able to make a 5$ payment to keep the server up for the month.

## You don't have my book? 

Join the chat and let me know more about what you are trying to find and I will help as much as I can. Soon I will have a dedicated request system where people can send me a message/email about the book I am missing and I may able to get a few of them.


#### Q: I want to donate!

For security reasons I will only take Crypto as forms of payment I have included a link at the bttom of the page that will help you set up a crypto wallet and buy some coins and from there you can send me either to buy a download link or make a donation.

I currently Accept Bitcoin, Monero, Ethereum and Litecoin.
